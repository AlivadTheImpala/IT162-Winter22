      <p>
        Im currently going to school pursuing a Web Design degree. My plan is to
        help my dad redesign his dog sanctuary web site
        <a href="https://www.greendogoasis.com/" target="_blank"
          >Green Dog Oasis.</a
        >
        I also plan to use my skills to help local businesses in designing a new
        website if theyre are in need to help get my work out in the real world.
      </p>

        When I'm not working on school I like to decompress by playing video
        games and delving into a story. RPG's used to be my jam growing up, and
        while I still love them, I find myself with limited time to actually
        finish them. Now I try to stick with only quests that interest me or
        sticking with a game thats a bit more narrative focused.
      </p>

      <h3 class="gamelist">Games I'm playing</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Death Stranding</li>
        <li>Pyschonauts 2</li>
        <li>Control</li>
      </ul>

        I've been a Windows user my whole life, but I recently bought a macbook
        pro. I bought a mac over a windows based laptop because the

          >m1 chips</a
        >
        had recently come out and I kept hearing really good things about them.
        I used to buy gaming laptops, but figured if I was going to be learning
        design and coding, I wanted something that was going to last for years
        to come and the m1 max just made sense to me. Overkill for my needs?
        probably. Worth it? definitely.
