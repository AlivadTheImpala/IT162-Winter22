          I'm currently going to school pursuing a Web Design degree. My plan is
          to help my dad redesign his dog sanctuary web site
          <a href="https://www.greendogoasis.com/" target="_blank"
            >Green Dog Oasis.</a
          >
          To help get my work out in the real world, I plan to use my skills to
          help local businesses design their own space on the internet.

          I've been a Windows user my whole life, but I recently bought a
          macbook pro. I bought a mac over a windows based laptop because the

          had recently come out and I kept hearing really good things about
          them. I used to buy gaming laptops, but figured if I was going to be
          learning design and coding, I wanted something that was going to last
          for years to come and the m1 max just made sense to me. Overkill for
          my needs? probably. Worth it? definitely.

          When I'm not working on school I like to decompress by playing video
          games and delving into a narrative. A good challenge and open ended
          design is what keeps me playing a game these days. Dark Souls and
          Demons Souls are some of my favorites in this arena.
